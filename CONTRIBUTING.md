## Getting involved

:+1::tada: First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

- After you have committed your changes push your changes to your forked repository
  using ``` git push origin mybug ```

- If everything is alright then soon your changes will get merged or else you will
  be asked to make changes.
